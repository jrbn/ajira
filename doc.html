	<p>If you just want to start using Ajira then you should first
	read our <a href="#getting_started">getting started</a> guide,
	which should teach you to set up the environment and start to
	use the framework.</p>

	<p>The next step would be to read
	our <a href="#tutorial">tutorial</a>, where we illustrate a
	small example application step-by-step. This should explain
	you the main ideas behind Ajira.</p>

	<p>Finally, if you are interested on what happens behind the
	curtains, then you should read our description of
	the <a href="">architecture</a> of Ajira, and
	the <a href="">philosophy</a> that drives its development.</p>

<h3 id="gs_download">Download and compile the code</h3>

<p>A simple clone with:</p>

<pre>git clone https://github.com/jrbn/ajira.git</pre>

<p>should do the job. After this, you must compile the codebase using
the ant file in the main directory. Just type:</p>

<pre>ant</pre>

<p>and the script will create the jars with all the program. These
files should be labeled with <code>ajira-XXX.jar</code>
and <code>ajira-webapps-XXX.jar</code>. The first jar contains the
actual program, while the second contains the .jsp files for the web
interface. Normally you need both, but if you decide not to use the
web interface than you can skip the second one.</p>

<p>As almost all java programs, Ajira depens on external
libraries. These are contained in the <i>lib/</i> directory. If you
want to use the program, remember to include also all the jars in this
directory in your classpath, otherwise you will have a problem. For
convienency, we added a script to copy all these jars in a "fat"
jar. If you want it, just type:</p>

<pre>ant fat-jar</pre>

<p>and the program will create a <code>ajira-fat-XXX.jar</code> jar
file.</p>

<h3 id="gs_single">Launch on a single node</h3>

<p>For a quick launch, you can try the <i>WordCount</i> example that
we added in the <i>nl.vu.cs.ajira.examples</i> package (in the
tutorial we will use this example to explain how the program
works). This program accepts in input a directory with a number of
text files with some generic text (the files can be either compressed
or not) and returns in output a list of words with the number of
occurrences that they appear on the text.</p>

<p>To launch the program, just type:</p>

<pre>java -cp ajira-fat-XXX.jar:conf/
nl.vu.cs.ajira.examples.WordCount &lt;inputdir&gt; &lt;outputdir&gt;</pre>

<p>where <i>inputdir</i> is the directory in input
 and <i>outputdir</i> the directory which will contain the results of
 the program (note that in this example the directory <i>conf/</i> is
 added to set a default logging level to info, otherwise all logging
 messages would be printed in output).</p>

<h3 id="t_overview">Overview</h3>

<p><u>An Ajira program consists of a list of <i>actions</i> to be
executed in a sequence.</u></p>

<p>Each of these <b>actions</b> receives some data in <b>input</b> and produces
some data in <b>output</b>. The data in output will become the input of
the action until the sequence is finished. At this point the program
is terminated.</p>

<p>A user who wants that wants to write a program in Ajira only needs
to define such sequence of actions, and to implement the actions that
are not already provided by the framework. Once this is done, Ajira
will take care of execution of the program in the most efficient way,
parallelizing and distributing it across the nodes.</p>

<p>In Ajira, <b>data</b> is always expressed as a number
of <b>tuples</b>, of variable length and type. The elements of the
tuples can be numbers (byte, int, or long), strings, booleans or
similar simple types. Because of this, actions are essentially
computational units that transforms tuples in other tuples.</p>

<p>For example, suppose that we want to sample a number of records
from a set of files, group them by a given criteria and write the
results on a number of files. To achieve this simple task, four
actions are necessary: 1) Read the data from the files; 2) sample the
input; 3) group it; 4) write the results on disk.Such program can be
written with Ajira with just a few lines.</p>

<p>As you can see, there are quite a number of similarities
between <b>Ajira</b> and <b>MapReduce</b>, but there is also an
important difference. In MapReduce, only two types of actions are
possible: a map and reduce. <u>In Ajira, you are not bound by a
two-phases computation, but you can construct a chain of computation
as complex as you like.</u></p>

<p>This allows the programmer a much greater flexibility in
implementing complex programs. For example, let's slightly change our
previous example, adding the operation of removing possible duplicates
in the input before executing the sampling. Performing this new task
in a single MapReduce job would be rather tricky, since we are
required to perform multiple sortings (one to clean the duplicates and
one to group the sample).</p>

<p>However, this is not the case of Ajira, where multiple sorting
phases can be stacked up in the same sequence of actions. To better
show this, we draw in Figure 1 a sketch of how a MapReduce program
would look like, and how the same operations would be written in
Ajira.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/mapreduce-ajira.png"
/><p><b>Figure 1:</b> Execution of a sample program using MapReduce
and Ajira.</p></div>

<p>The execution of an Ajira program is sequential, since the actions
are executed one after the other. However, in reality the framework
tries to parallelize the execution and even to distribute it across
several peers in a (semi)transparent way. For example, consider the
standard action <i>ReadFromFiles</i>, which is provided by the
framework and which task is to read the content on some files and feed
it to the next actions in the list. Here, the user only specifies at
what point this action should be executed in the sequence (e.g.
ReadFromFiles->Sample->WriteToFiles), but nothing more.</p>

<p>When Ajira will physically execute this action, it will first
create a number of concurrent "chains" depending on the input
size. For example, if there are two files, <i>fileA.txt</i>
and <i>fileB.txt</i>, Ajira create two concurrent chains of actions
where one will process the content of <i>fileA.txt</i> while the other
will process the content of <i>fileB.txt</i>.</p>

<p>If the user needs that the flow of tuples in one sequence must be
converged to one or multiple processors (for example to apply some
aggregating operations), then Ajira provides a number of special
actions, like <i>CollectToNode</i> or <i>PartitionToNodes</i> to make
sure that all the tuples that are processed in parallel are collected
in one single point.</p>

<p>We will now take the classical MapReduce WordCount example, and
show how we can rewrite it in Ajira.</p>

<h3 id="t_example">Example: WordCount</h3>

<p>The scope of this tutorial is to understand how a simple program
that written using the Ajira framework works. To this end, let's take
example
program <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java"><i>WordCount.java</i></a>
and start reading the code, to understand how it works.</p>

<p>The purpose of this program is to count the occurrences of words in
a text files. After MapReduce, became a sort of <i>Hello World</i> for
data intensive applications. The program receives in input a set of
files and returns in output a number of pairs where the first element
is a word that occurred at least once in the input collection and the
second element the number of times that it occurred.</p>

<p>The program can be divided in two parts. The first, which is
between
lines <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L118">118</a>
and <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L133">133</a>,
takes care of initializing the framework. In this phase, the framework
can be customized by setting some parameters (in the example,
N_PROC_THREADS indicates the number of concurrent threads that can
perform the actual computation).</p>

<p>After the initialization is completed, the framework can be started
with the command <i><a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L130">Ajira.startup()</a></i>. Note that this code must be
executed on all nodes that participate in the computation. After this
function is executed, Ajira is running and waiting to receive a
submission.</p>

<p>The function <i><a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L133">Ajira.amITheServer()</a></i> is used to make sure that
some code is executed only once and not on every instance of the
program. In fact, this function will return <i>true</i> only on one
node (actually the first that joins the computation). This means that
the <i>if</i> in lines <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L116">116</a>-<a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L150">150</a> will be executed only on one node and
skipped on all the other instances.</p>

<p>Inside this <i>if</i> we set up the computation that will execute
the WordCount program. This is done in the
function <i><a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L79">createJob()</a></i>. We report the content of the function below:</p>

<pre>
public static Job createJob(String inDir, String outDir)
			throws ActionNotConfiguredException {

Job job = new Job();
ActionSequence actions = new ActionSequence();

// Read the input files
ActionConf action = ActionFactory.getActionConf(ReadFromFiles.class);
action.setParamString(ReadFromFiles.S_PATH, inDir);
actions.add(action);

// Count the words
actions.add(ActionFactory.getActionConf(CountWords.class));

// Groups the pairs
action = ActionFactory.getActionConf(GroupBy.class);
action.setParamStringArray(GroupBy.SA_TUPLE_FIELDS,
		TString.class.getName(), TInt.class.getName());
action.setParamByteArray(GroupBy.IA_FIELDS_TO_GROUP, (byte) 0);
actions.add(action);

// Sum the counts
actions.add(ActionFactory.getActionConf(SumCounts.class));

// Write the results on files
action = ActionFactory.getActionConf(WriteToFiles.class);
action.setParamString(WriteToFiles.S_OUTPUT_DIR, outDir);
actions.add(action);

job.setActions(actions);
return job;

}</pre>

<p>Here we define a list of actions that need to be executed in a
sequence in order to implement the operations required by the
program. The first action is called <i>ReadFromFiles</i> and is a
standard action provided by the framework. Its task is to read the
files in input and return their contents to the following actions. The
content is returned as a number of tuples, where each tuple contains a
line of the text files (in case, it is possible to set a custom reader
that returns tuples with different structure or content).</p>

The operation is done with the instruction <br/><br/> <pre>ActionConf
action = ActionFactory.getActionConf(ReadFromFiles.class);</pre> which
is used to retrieve an object that contains the configuration of the
action. Depending on the action, such object will accept certain
parameters instead of others. The second
line, <code>action.setParamString(ReadFromFiles.S_PATH, inDir)</code>,
simply sets as the action parameter the directory to be read in
input.</p>

<p>The second action that needs to be executed is
called <i>CountWords</i> and must be defined by the user. In the code
it is defined in
lines <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L38">38</a>-<a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L54">54</a>. For
clarity we report it below.</p>

<pre>
public static class CountWords extends Action {

@Override
public void process(Tuple tuple, ActionContext context,
                    ActionOutput actionOutput) throws Exception {
	TString iText = (TString) tuple.get(0);
	String sText = iText.getValue();
	if (sText != null && sText.length() > 0) {
		String[] words = sText.split("\\s+");
		for (String word : words) {
			if (word.length() > 0) {
				TString oWord = new TString(word);
				actionOutput.output(oWord, new TInt(1));
			}
		}
	}
}
}
</pre>

<p>The only method that the abstract action <i>Action</i> requires to
implement is the method <i>process(...)</i>. This method receives as
input one tuple and produces in output one of more
tuples. Note that here an <i>action</i> resembles very much the task of
a <i>Map</i> in the MapReduce model since also here one tuple can
generate zero or more other tuples (however, note that in our case an
action can do much more than a <i>map</i>).</p>

<p>In fact, here the action <i>CountWords</i> does exactly the same
task as the <i>Map phase</i> in the MapReduce version of this example:
Split the input text in words, and for each of them output a new
pair <i>("word", 1)</i>. This operation is done in the process(...)
method of this action.</p>

<p>The third action is called <i>GroupBy</i> and is a standard action
provided by the framework. The <i>process</i> method of this action
will receive in input the output of the <i>CountWords</i> action and
it will group it other tuples that will be passed to the following
action. Once again, this action is needed to simulate exactly the
computation that occurs in MapReduce: In fact, also there the output
of the <i>Map</i> need to be grouped by the framework so that on each group a
<i>Reduce</i> action could be applied.</p>

<p>This action needs some parameters. First we need to tell it exactly
which type of tuples the action will receive in input. This is
necessary for the sorting. In the example, each tuple is composed by a
string (TString) and an integer (TInt). The second parameter
(<i>IA_FIELDS_TO_GROUP</i>) is needed to indicate which fields of the
tuple we should use to group the entire tuple. In our case we want the
tuples being grouped by the word and therefore we set this parameter
to the value 0.</p>

<p>The third action is the "reduce" of the MapReduce counterpart program. In our example this action is called <i>SumCounts</i> and is defined in lines <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L64">64</a>-<a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L76">76</a>.</p>

<pre>
public static class SumCounts extends Action {

@Override
public void process(Tuple tuple, ActionContext context,
         	ActionOutput actionOutput) throws Exception {
	TString word = (TString) tuple.get(0);
	TBag values = (TBag) tuple.get(1);

	long sum = 0;
	for (Tuple t : values) {
		sum += ((TInt) t.get(0)).getValue();
	}
	actionOutput.output(word, new TLong(sum));
}
}
</pre>

<p>This action receives in input a tuple that contains first all the
fields that were used as a key by the <i>GroupBy</i> action and as
last field an instance of the class <i>TBag</i> that contains a
collection of the tuples in each group. Exactly as it happens in
MapReduce, this class sums the number 1 produces by the
action <i>CountWords</i> and return these values in the output.</p>

<p>The last action in the chain is called <i>WriteToFiles</i> and is a
standard action provided by the framework. The task of this action is
to write the tuples in input on files. The output directory is
indicated with the parameter <i>S_OUTPUT_DIR</i>.</p>

<p>Once the job is defined, the user can execute it launching the
command <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L138">Ajira.waitForCompletion()</a>. Once
the job is executed, it is possible to print out some statistics about
the execution with the
command <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/examples/WordCount.java#L139">Submission.printStatistics()</a>.</p>

<p><b>Great!</b> Was everything clear? Once again, the scope of this
tutorial was to simply make you familiar with the framework. As you
could read from it, we only had to define the flow of actions
necessary to perform our task. In this example, these actions mimic
exactly the behaviour of MapReduce, since the two actions that are
defined by the user can be mapped directly in the "map" and "reduce"
functions of MapReduce.</p>

<p>In others, more advanced documents that you can find on this
website, we will describe the framework in more detail, focusing on
how the computation is physically carried on and on all actions that
is possible to execute. We encourage you to read them, but first try
out this example on your machine so that you can get a concrete
feeling on how the framework works in practice.</p>

<p>An Ajira cluster is made by one or more Ajira instances that
communicate to each others through the network. In Figure 2, we show a
typical example of Ajira cluster. In the Figure, each Ajira instance
consists of a single Java program that runs on the same or different
machines. The IBIS registry is an additional program that runs on one
machine. Its purpose is to simply register the location of each
machine and broadcast this information to the other instances, so that
each one is aware of everybody else.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/overview.png"
/><p><b>Figure 2:</b> Overview of an Ajira Cluster.</p></div>

<p>An user submits an Ajira program to one node of this network, which will
initiliaze the computation and makes sure the result is returned to
the user.</p>

<p>There are several components within each Ajira instance that are
quite important. The first is called <i>I/O Layer</i> and it is the
layer that handles the communication between the framework and the
physical data source from where the data is retrieved. More in
particular, it exchanges <i>tuples</i> of data, which are the way data
is represented in the framework. We discuss respectivily the I/O Layer and the
tuples <a href="#a_iolayer">here</a> and <a href="#a_tuples">here</a>.</p>

<p>Once the data is retrieved by the I/O layer, the framework starts
feeding it the Ajira program, which consists on a sequence of actions
that process the tuples in input. The execution of these actions
happens in parallel, since the framework starts a number of concurrent
threads to process the actions on multiple portions of the data. We
will discuss the structure of actions, and the execution of such
sequences <a href="#a_actions">here</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, other important components of every Ajira instances are
the <i>buckets</i>, which are responsible for temporary storing the
data and send them through the network. We discuss them
extensivily <a href="#a_buckets">here</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a_iolayer">I/O Layer</h3>

<p>The I/O layer is responsible of returning an iterator tuples that
should serve as input to the sequence of actions. This iterator is
dependent to a query that the framework requests to the
layer. Therefore, we can see the input layer as a sort of database,
which returns a set of results (in the form of a sequential
iterator) given a specific query in input.</p>

<p>For example, the
standard <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/datalayer/files/FileLayer.java">FileLayer</a>
represents the layer if the Ajira program wants to read the input from
files. In this case, an example of query that the framework could
launch to the input layer could be the tuple <i>(1,xxx)</i>, which is
interpreted by the input layer as "Returns me the content of file xxx
(this is the code for the operation '1') using the standard
iterator."</p>

<p>Once it has receives this query query, the input layer returns an
appropriate iterator of
type <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/datalayer/TupleIterator.java">TupleIterator</a>,
that contains the tuple that satify the query. Then, the framework
reads each elements returned by the iterator, feeds these tuples to
the first action of the sequence, and once the iterator is finished it
releases it by returning it to the input layer.</p>

<p>The actions in one ajira action can read the tuples from an
arbitrary number of iterators. For example, some actions could read
the content of some files, while others could read data from a stream
of data. Before the Ajira framework is started, we can set a default
input layer, which will be used in case no input layer is
specified. This operation is done using the code:</p>

<pre>Ajira ajira = new Ajira();
Configuration conf = ajira.getConfiguration();
InputLayer.setDefaultInputLayerClass("inputLayerClass", conf);</pre>

<p>The only difference between the default input layer and all the
others is that for such input layer the framework calls an
initialization method when it is loaded. This gives the possibility to
the user to set up the I/O system before the computation can take
place (this could become particular handy if our input layer was, for
example, the interface to a relational database).</p>

<p>Now, let's discuss the APIs offered by the input layer. Basically,
every input layer must be defined as a subclass of the abstract
class <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/datalayer/InputLayer.java">InputLayer</a>.</p>

<p>Each subclass must implement four methods:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>load()</i>: This method is invoked once by the framework when
the cluster is started. The frameworks calls it only for the default
input layer.</li>
<li><i>getIterator(Tuple tuple, ActionContext context)</i>: This
method returns a tuple iterator given an input query (which is
contained in a generic tuple). The structure and content of the query
depends on the I/O layer. For example, a query for the FileLayer
could be <i>(1,"/file1.txt")</i> while for another layer could have a
completely different structure.</li>
<li><i>releaseIterator(TupleIterator itr, ActionContext action)</i>:
Once the tuple iterator is used, the framework releases it to the I/O
layer, which can possibly reuse it or perform additional computation
to clean up the itertor state.</li>
<li><i>getLocations(Tuple tuple, ActionContext context)</i>: This
method is invoked by the framework to know in which node the given
query could be answered. In fact, some queries might be answered only
on a specific node of the cluster. If this is the case, then the
framework will first transfer the list of action to this node, and
there request a tuple iterator. Note, that this method returns an
object of
type <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/chains/Location.java">Location</a>,
which is used to indicate a location in the cluster. This object can
return: (i) the ID of one node in the cluster (in the range from 0 to
n, where n is the number of Ajira instances); (ii) -1, if this query
should be executed on all the nodes; (iii) -2, if the query can be
answered only on the local node.</li>
</ul>

<p>This last method can be used to redirect the computation to some
specific nodes. For this moment, it is possible to redirect either to
another single node, or to replicate it on all the nodes. In both
cases, the framework will take care of distributing the list of
actions over the network and make sure that the program correctly
terminates.</p>

<p>The iterator must be a subclass
of <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/datalayer/TupleIterator.java">TupleIterator</a>. This
abstract class requires the implementation of three methods:
(i) <i>isReady()</i>, which returns true if the iterator can start
returning tuples; (ii) <i>next()</i>, which returns whether there is a
new tuple to be read; (iii) <i>getTuple(Tuple tuple)</i>, to retrieve
the content of the current tuple.</i>

<h3 id="a_tuples">Tuples and Datatypes</h3>

<p>In traditional MapReduce applications, data is expressed as a set
of <i>key/value</i> pairs. In Ajira, we relax this constraint, and
define the data as a set of generic <b>tuples</b>, of arbitrary type
and length. For example, one tuple could contain three, or four
elements, and the type of this elements can be changed at
runtime. This allows us to represent the underlying data in a much
more intuitive way, without using expensive and complex mechanisms to
serialize complex data structures on <i>key/value</i> pairs.</p>

<p>More in particular, we simply require that each element of the
tuple is an instance of the abstract
class <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/data/types/SimpleData.java">SimpleData</a>. The framework already provides the
implementation for many standard types, such as strings, integers, longs,
boolean, etc. We report all the supported types in the table below:

<table>
<th>Type</th><th>Description</th>
<tr>
  <td><i>TInt</i></td>
  <td>An Integer number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TString</i></td>
  <td>A String number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TBoolean</i></td>
  <td>A Boolean number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TLong</i></td>
  <td>A Long number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TByte</i></td>
  <td>A Byte number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TDouble</i></td>
  <td>A Double number.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TBag</i></td>
  <td>A collection of tuples (used in the <i>GroupBy</i> action).</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TIntArray</i></td>
  <td>An array of integers.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TByteArray</i></td>
  <td>An array of bytes.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TStringArray</i></td>
  <td>An array of strings.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TLongArray</i></td>
  <td>An array of longs.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td><i>TDoubleArray</i></td>
  <td>An array of doubles.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Notice that if your application needs to use a special type, then you
can define it by creating as a subclass of <i>SimpleData</i>. However,
in this case you need to register your data type before you start your
architecture. This can be done by calling the static
method <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/data/types/DataProvider.java">DataProvider.get().addType("Your
Typle".class)</a>.</p>

<h3 id="a_actions">Actions</h3>

<p>The kernel of computation in an Ajira cluster is represented by the
actions. As we described in the tutorial, an Ajira program is in its
essence nothing but a sequence of actions.</p>

<p>In Ajira, each action must inherit the abstract
class <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/actions/Action.java">Action</a>. The
only method that you must implement is <i>process()</i>, which
receives one tuple in input and produces zero or more tuples in
output. This can be done using the method <i>output()</i> provided by
the <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/actions/ActionOutput.java">ActionOutput</a>
object.</p>

<p>When an action is added to a sequence, the framework gives us the
possibility to customize the execution by adding some
parameters. These parameters can be set by using the
method <i>setParam*</i> of the
class <a href="https://github.com/jrbn/ajira/blob/master/src/nl/vu/cs/ajira/actions/ActionConf.java">ActionConf</a>. This
method requests that we specify an parameter id next to the value to
assign. The list of parameters IDs can be set overriding the
method <i>registerActionParameter()</i> of <i>Action</i>. This method
allows us to specify which parameters are allowed by invoking the
method <i>registerParameter()</i> of <i>ActionConf</i>.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following code:</p>

<pre>public final int PARAM1 = 0;
public final int PARAM2 = 1;

registerActionParameters(ActionConf conf) {
 conf.registerParameter(PARAM1, "desc. param 1", null, true);
 conf.registerParameter(PARAM2, "desc. param 2", 10, false);
}</pre>

<p>With this code, we allow two parameters for our
action, <i>PARAM1</i> and <i>PARAM2</i>. The first has ID=0, while the
second has ID=1. We require that the first parameter is always set
(cannotBeNull=true), while the second assumes
the default value of 10, unless it is specified.</p>

<p>Within the action, the actual value of the parameters can be
retrieved using the methods <i>getParam*(PARAM_ID)</i>. Normally these
parameters are useful when the process starts or closes. To allow the
user to customize the computation in these two phases, the framework
invokes two methods of Action that can be overriden by the user. These
are:</p>

<ul>
<li><i>startProcess()</i>: This method is invoked once before the
action starts to receive tuples in input through the <i>process()</i>
method. You can use it to initialize your data structures.</li>

<li><i>stopProcess()</i>: Similarly, this method is invoked once after
the action has received all the tuples in input. Notice that in this
method you can still output some tuples. This can be useful in case
you need to alert the following actions that the flow is
finished.</li>
</ul>

<p>You must keep in mind a very important principle when you are
writing the code of your action: <u>There is only one way to ensure a
single global flow in the system, and we will describe it later when
we discuss the buckets. In all the other cases, the same action can be
concurrently executed multiple times on different parts of the
input. Therefore, never make the assumption that there is only one
process flow.</u> The only assumption that you can make is that before
and after any <i>process()</i> call there will be
one <i>startProcess()</i>, and one <i>stopProcess()</i> call.</p>

<p>In fact, some actions can create multiple processing flows which
execute the same sequence of actions on different data. This is done
concurrently, since in each Ajira instance there are normally
multiplw <i>action processors</i> that initialize the sequences of
actions and coordinate the passing of tuples between the list of
actions.</p>

<p>Furthermore, there can be cases where a static computational flow
is not enough and new sequences must be created at runtime. In this
case, the object <i>ActionOutput</i> in <i>process()</i>
and <i>stopProcess()</i> allows the user to perform two useful
operations: <i>branching</i> and <i>splitting</i>.</p>

<p>We first describe the branch operation. As an example, suppose we
have a simple list of actions from A to E, as shown in the Figure
below.</p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/branch.png"
/><p><b>Figure 3:</b> <i>Branch</i> operation.</p></div>

<p>During the action C, we might want to send more tuples to the
following actions that come from a different computation than the
current flow. In this case, action C can create a <i>branch</i>
composed by the actions F, and G, and the tuples outputed by this new
sequence will be send directly to the action D.</p>

<p>This operation can be particularly useful if we need to implement
explorative operations, which are operations which complexity depends
on the data that is being processed. Some examples could be the
execution of data joins (i.e. we need to read both sides of the join
only if there is data that satifies one of them), or the execution of
rules in logic programming.</p>

<p>Branching can be implemented by the user in a very simple way:
simply call the method <i>branch(ActionSequence sequence)</i>
indicating which actions should be executed in the branch and the
framework will take care to create the new sequence, assign its
execution to a local or remote thread, and ensure that the flow is
correctly handled.</p>

<p>However, notice one important aspect: branching cannot be used to
change the destiny to the tuples produced by the current action. It
can only be used to add more tuples that come from a different source
(this is translated in one addition query to the input layer, and the
usage of one more action processor to process the new actions).</p>

<p>If, during the execution of one action, we want that the tuples
that are being produced are processed in a different way, then we can
use the <i>split</i> operation. Once again, suppose as example that we
have a simple sequence of actions from A to E as reported in the
figure below. </p>

<div style="text-align: center"><img src="img/split.png"
/><p><b>Figure 4:</b> <i>Split</i> operation.</p></div>

<p>Here, the action C can create a split with the new actions F and G,
and send the tuples that it produces through this channel rather than
the default one. When the action creates a split, it can specify after
how many actions the split can be reconnected to the main flow. This
is useful if we want that only a limited number of operations is
skipped, and the output of G is send as input to one action between D
and E.</p>
